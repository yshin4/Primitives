**CMSI 371** Computer Graphics, Spring 2017

# Assignment 0313
This assignment is focused on having you spend some time on the primitive side of graphics, in order to gain an appreciation for what it takes to implement these lower-level graphics operations.

## Background Reading

## Automated Feedback Setup
In order to connect your repository to our automated code review and feedback system, once you are up and running please send your repository’s URL to Ed Seim. You can either find him in person in the lab, tweet him at [https://twitter.com/SirSeim](https://twitter.com/SirSeim), or mention him in a GitHub comment (`SirSeim`). Once he has you hooked up, the system will provide feedback on code formatting and quality whenever you commit a new version to GitHub. _Points will be deducted if issues here linger in the final submission._

For this assignment, a unit test suite is not practical to do: the “demo pages” pretty much comprise a visual test suite. Thus, automated feedback only covers code presentation and formatting.

## Primitives

### Easy
Implement a two-color radial gradient for rectangles.

### Medium
Implement a linear two-color gradient for polygons.

### (Best Value!) Hard
Implement a multipoint linear gradient for polygons.

## Image Processing
Implement two single-pixel (nanoshop) and two neighborhood-pixel (nanoshop-neighborhood) filters of your own design.

## Summary of Deliverables
- One chosen primitive implementation
- Two single-pixel filters
- Two neighborhood-pixel filters
